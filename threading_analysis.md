# Threading and Deadlock Analysis

## Identified Issues and Fixes

### 1. Potential Race Condition in CryptoAnalyzer._start_analysis_if_ready()

**Issue**: The method checks multiple conditions without proper synchronization. The `_initial_data_loaded` Event is set but there's a potential race condition between
checking if data is None and setting the event.

**Fix Applied**: Added proper synchronization by using the event before checking conditions.

### 2. Deadlock Prevention in AnalysisJob

**Issue**: The `_counter_lock` in AnalysisJob could potentially cause deadlock if exceptions occur during correlation analysis.

**Current Implementation**: Uses proper lock management with context managers (with statement), which ensures locks are released even if exceptions occur.

### 3. Database Thread Safety

**Issue**: SQLite connections in DatabaseManager are created with `check_same_thread=False`, which could lead to issues.

**Status**: This is acceptable as the DatabaseManager runs in its own dedicated thread via QueueWorkerThread, ensuring sequential access.

## Threading Architecture

The application uses a proper producer-consumer pattern with:

- **OrchestratorBase**: Main coordinator (CryptoAnalyzer)
- **QueueWorkerThread**: Base class for workers (DataFetcher, RSICalculator, DatabaseManager, DisplayAgent)
- **ServiceBus**: Event-driven communication between components

## Recommendations

1. **Timeout Implementation**: Consider adding timeouts to critical sections to prevent indefinite waiting.
2. **Monitoring**: Add logging for lock acquisition/release to detect potential deadlocks.
3. **Error Recovery**: Ensure all critical sections have proper exception handling.

## Current Thread Safety Measures

✅ All workers use QueueWorkerThread with internal task queues
✅ Database operations are serialized through DatabaseManager's queue
✅ Locks use context managers for automatic release
✅ Event-driven architecture reduces direct thread synchronization needs
